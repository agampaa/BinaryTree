BinaryTree
==========

Assumptions: The tree is a ordered or sorted binary tree which has the following properties:

    The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with values less than the node's value.
    The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with values greater than the node's value.
    The left and right subtree must each also be a binary search tree.
